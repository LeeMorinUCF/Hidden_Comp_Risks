In 2008, the province of Quebec drastically increased penalties for speeding 
well above the speed limit by doubling fines and instituting on-the-spot license suspension. 
Using administrative driving and licensing records in Quebec from 2006 to 2010, 
we examine whether the new law discouraged unlawful driving behaviour 
by investigating the frequency with which motorists received traffic citations. 
We find that males became less likely to get traffic tickets after the law came into effect, 
with the largest effects on those aged 16 to 24. 
However, females did not largely change their behaviour in response to this new law.
